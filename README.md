# Week 5 - Dom Html

We have seen how to select elements in the html and how to change/create/remove these elements or theyr CSS properties.

Now we are going to practice these skills that are the building block for building interactive websites and understand how JS is used to dinamically modify information in other parts of our website/files.

Please review every method from the slides:
- Selecting and collecting elements
- Changing style
- Adding/removing/replacing elements

If you did not understand something please look up the documentation by searching: <br>
**"DOM html javascript" + "change style" or "select class" or "add element"**

If you still cannot find the solution (after having read the examples and the explanation) ask right away.
